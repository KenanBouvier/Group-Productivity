How to create new Goal:

Decided to just create new page create.php where there is a "form" to submit a new goal. Always including the sidebar as it feels more seamless as the page is always the same.

Status bar(for shared people)

- have their name:  tick/cross
I think I should keep it simple as it conveys the important info - don't want excess "stuff"
